# Sloving Knapsack Problem 

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the problem is to determine the number of each item included in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers must choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.
