# Graph Theory Small Programs

## Graph Theory

Graph theory including: admissible degree sequences, Eulerian graphs, Hamiltonian graphs, and related topics in combinatorics. Particular attention will be focused on graph theory algorithms such as the travelling salesman problem and max flow/min cut, including applications.

## Java Programs

* [Admissible Degree Sequences](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/Admissable/Admissable.md)
* [Bipartite Graph](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/Bipartite/Bipartite.md)
* [Eulerian Graph](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/EulerianGraph/EulerianGraph.md)
* [Measurements Graph](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/GraphMeasurements/MeasurementsGraph.java)
* [Hamiltonian Graph](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/HamiltonianGraphs/Hamiltonian.java)
* [Sloving Knapsack Problem](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/KnapsackProblem/knapsack%20problem.md)
* [Warshall Algortihm](https://github.com/MeloShen/Graph-Theory-Programs/blob/main/Code/WarshallAlgortihm/WarshallAlgortihm.md)


## Appendix

I learned a lot of mathematical knowledge in this project. I used my weak programming knowledge to write some programs related to grap theory. When I have tried to write DoubleLinkedList in hamiltonian graph, I am faced with a big problem. I hope someone can point out my problem, thanks again to my math teachers, and computer teachers, and anyone who might see these programs.
