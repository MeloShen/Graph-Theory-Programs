# Graph Theory Small Programs

## Graph Theory

Graph theory including: admissible degree sequences, Eulerian graphs, Hamiltonian graphs, and related topics in combinatorics. Particular attention will be focused on graph theory algorithms such as the travelling salesman problem and max flow/min cut, including applications.
