# Hamiltonian Graph

## what is hamiltonian graph
We call a u-wpath P in a multigraph G = (V, E, φ) a Hamilton path if every vertex v ∈ V appears in P (exactly once). We call a cycle C in G a Hamilton cycle if every vertex v ∈ V appears in C. If G contains a Hamilton cycle we say the graph G is Hamiltonian.

## How to hamiltonian graph
If G is a simple graph of order n(≥ 3), and if for every pair, u, w of non-adjacent vertices:
    
    δ(u) + δ(w) ≥ n

then G is Hamiltonian.
