## what is admissible degree sequences

The degree sequence of a graph is the non-increasing sequence of
its vertex degrees. A finite, non-increasing sequence of none negative integers is said to be admissable is there is some simple graph with that sequence.

## How to identified is admissable

By Havel and Hakimi: A sequence (d1, d2, . . . dn) is admissable if, and only if, (d2 − 1, d3 − 1, . . . . . . dn) is admissible (once reordered to a non-increasing sequence).
