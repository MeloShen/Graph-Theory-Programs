## Diameter

### What is diameter
The diameter of graph is the maximum distance between the pair of vertices. It can also be defined as the maximal distance between the pair of vertices. 

### How to get diameter
It can be found by finding the maximum value of eccentricity from all the vertices.

## Radius

### What is radius
A radius of the graph exists only if it has the diameter. The minimum among all the maximum distances between a vertex to all other vertices is considered as the radius of the Graph G. 

### How to get radius
It can be found by finding the minimum value of eccentricity from all the vertices.
